This topic describes how to install and configure Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster (RLEC) Service Broker, as well as how to create an instance of the RLEC service from the Marketplace of your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment.

##<a id='installing-rlec'></a>Install RLEC

To use the RLEC Service Broker, you must have a RLEC cluster already deployed. Configuring the RLEC Service Broker requires a RLEC admin account username and password, as well as the URL of your RLEC cluster.

To download and install RLEC, follow the instructions in the [RLEC documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/installing-and-upgrading/accessing-and-installing-the-setup-package). RLEC is available as an Amazon Web Services AMI or as an installation package for Ubuntu and Red Hat / CentOS.

For more information about how to install RLEC and create a cluster, see the [RLEC documentation](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise-documentation/overview).

##<a id='create-db'></a> Create a Redis Database in Apps Manager

After installing the RLEC Service Broker, the Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster appears as a service in the Marketplace of your deployment. Developers can provision Redis databases by creating service instances using Apps Manager or the cf Command Line Interface (CLI).

Follow the instructions below to create a Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster service instance using Apps Manager.

1. Navigate to Apps Manager in a browser and log in.
1. Click **Marketplace**.
1. Click **Redis Labs Enterprise Cluster**.
1. Choose one of the four preconfigured database plans and click **Select this plan**. For more information about the preconfigured plans, see the [Overview](index.html#overview).
1. In the **Configure Instance** form, enter an **Instance Name** to identify the service instance in the deployment as well as the database name in RLEC. To override the default parameters and provide additional database configuration parameters, click **Show Advanced Options**. Contact support@redislabs.com for further instructions on using this feature.
1. Once your service is created and bound to an app, the credentials will be stored in `VCAP_SERVICES` in the following format:

```
"VCAP_SERVICES": {
  "redislabs-enterprise-cluster": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "redis-12345.pcf-rlec.redislabs.com",
     "ip_list": [
      "10.0.0.171"
     ],
     "password": "some-redis-password",
     "port": 12345
    },
    "label": "redislabs-enterprise-cluster",
    "name": "my-redis-db",
    "plan": "ha-redis",
    "provider": null,
    "syslog_drain_url": null,
    "tags": [
     "redislabs"
    ]
   }
  ]
}
```
